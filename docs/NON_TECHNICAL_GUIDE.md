## Important System Concepts (Simplified)

### Order Statuses
Orders move through different stages:

1. **Pending** - Order just created, waiting to be assigned
2. **Draft** - Assigned to contractor but not started
3. **In Progress** - Contractor is working on it
4. **Completed** - All done, customer can access emails
5. **Cancelled** - Order was cancelled
6. **Rejected** - Contractor couldn't complete it (goes back to queue)

### Pool Orders
**What's different:** Instead of regular orders, pool orders work with customer's own domain list
- Customer provides a list of domains
- System allocates domains to "pool panels"
- Emails are created for each domain

**Use case:** For customers with many domains who need emails for all of them.

### Domain Removal
**What it is:** Cleaning up when subscriptions end
- When customer cancels, we schedule domain removal
- Gives customer 30 days to backup their data
- System automatically removes domains after 30 days
